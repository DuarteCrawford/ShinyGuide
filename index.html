            <h2>Shiny Pokémon</h2>
            <p>Shiny Pokémon are Pokémon with different coloration from their standard counterparts. They provide no aditional help in battle but some have real neat color schemes, which in turns makes some fans of the games actively search for them. However, Shiny Pokémon are much rarer than your usual Pokémon. And that's why I created this guide. Here, hopefully, you'll find tips on how to catch shiny Pokémon a bit easier than just random encounters. There are various methods to up your odds, depending on the game you're playing. In Scarlet and Violet, the best methods are the Masuda Method, the Mass Outbreak Method and the Sparkling Power Sandwich Method.</p>

        <h2> Masuda Method </h2>
        <p>The Masuda Method is a simple, yet boring, method of shiny hunting. It consists of putting two Pokémon breeding in a Picnic, with one parent being from a different language game than your own. Usually players trade Ditto for this purpose since it's the only Pokémon able to breed with every Pokémon that can produce eggs.</p>

        <p> After you collect enough eggs in the picnic basket, add them to your party, grab a Pokémon with the Flame Body ability, and hop on your legendary Pokémon to travel the distance to hatch all those eggs. Hopefully one of them ends up shiny!</p>

<h2> Mass Outbreaks </h2>
<p> Mass Outbreaks are in-game events that happen every 24h. When you boot up the game you should be notified there are mass outbreaks happening. If you open your Map you can check what Pokémon are spawning in this method. After you pick your target you should travel to the corresponding location and start battling the outbreak Pokémon, I recommend using the Let's Go battle mode. After you defeat 60+ encounters you will receive a text notifying you that there are barely any pokémon left from the original outbreak. </p>
<img src = "Imagens/flamigo.jpeg" width="1280" height="auto">
<p> After this message you can just wait for Pokémon to spawn in and out. Some methods to accelarate this process are hopping in and out of a Picnic or leaving the area and coming back. After a while, if you're lucky you might find a shiny Pokémon!</p>

<h2>Sparkling Power Sandwich</h2>
<p> This method is very effective for hunting Pokémon that can't be bred or are unavailable in Mass Outbreaks. The catch here is that you'll have to sacrifice those very hard to find Herba Mystica. If parting ways with these rare ingredients is not a problem just follow the recipes in the image bellow. Don't forget to use the typing matching the Pokémon you're hunting for.  </p>
<p> Below I'll list the recipes for those sparkling sandwiches for every type.</p>
<p> 1 - Use one "serving" of the following ingredients:</p>
<ol>
    <li><u> Cucumber;</u></li>
    <li><u> Pickle. </u></li>
    </ol>
<p> 2 - Use three "servings" of the ingredient for the type you need:</p>
<table>
    <col><col><col><col>
    <th colspan="4"> Type dependent ingredients </th>
    <tr>
    <td> Normal </td> <td> Tofu </td> <td> Flying </td> <td> Prosciutto </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Fire </td> <td> Red Pepper </td> <td> Psychic </td> <td> Onion </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Water </td> <td> Cucumber </td> <td> Bug </td> <td> Cherry Tomato </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Electric </td> <td> Yellow Pepper </td> <td> Rock </td> <td> Bacon </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Grass </td> <td> Lettuce </td> <td> Ghost </td> <td> Red Onion </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Ice </td> <td> Klawf Stick </td> <td> Dragon </td> <td> Avocado </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Fighting </td> <td> Pickle </td> <td> Dark </td> <td> Smoke Fillet </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Poison </td> <td> Green Pepper </td> <td> Steel </td> <td> Hamburger </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Ground </td> <td> Ham </td> <td> Fairy </td> <td> Tomato </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<p> 3 - Add any two Herba Mysticas: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Bitter; </li>
    <li> Spicy;</li>
    <li> Salty; </li>
    <li> Sour;</li>
    <li> Sweet. </li>
    </ul>
<p> 4 - Make the Sandwich!</p>

<p> The effects of the sandwich will last for 30 mins and can even stack with the Mass Outbreak odds for increased chance of finding the shiny.</p>

    <h3> What are the odds? </h3> 
    <p> The base odds are 1/4096, the Masuda Method odds are 1/682, the Mass Outbreak odds are 1/1365, and the Sparkling Power Sandwich odds are 1/1024. All this without the Shiny Charm, which increases your odds even further. </p>
